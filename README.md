# SMSFox
Firefox OS application to serve as a web relay to send and receive messages.

## Initial objectives

* Mastering the entire compilation process of applications under Firefox OS
* Understanding the native SMS application of Firefox OS
* Developping a secure website which can send SMS through the application
* Communicating with connected objects
* ...

## How to make it work ?
```batchfile
$ git clone https://github.com/FoxHoundAlphaUnit/SMSFox.git SMSFox
$ cd SMSFox
```
Then, you'll have to compile:
* css/app.sass -> css/app.css

And minify all the app css and js files:
* css/app.css -> css/app.min.css
* css/libs/materialize.css -> css/libs/materialize.min.css
* js/app.js -> js/app.min.js
* js/server.js -> js/server.min.js

Finally, you can load the app into an emulator or your own Firefox OS phone using WebIDE (available in the Firefox browser) and it should work!
